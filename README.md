Abstract
In this research, we looked at the 'Google Play Store Apps' data and used various statistical methods and visualization tools to sort and analyze it. The goal was to predict the "Rating" of apps, which can be anywhere from 1 to 19, using a linear regression model. We checked the quality of the data and figured out which features were most significant in determining the Rating. To do this, we used tools like p-value, t-statistics, histograms, Q-Q plots, heat maps, and box plots to find answers to our questions and have a better understanding of the data. We also used the Seaborn library to make our data analysis and visualization better.


• Which independent variables are useful to predict a target (dependent variable)?
• Which independent variables have missing data? How much
• Do the training and test sets have the same data?
• In the predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?
• Which predictor variables are the most important?
• Do the ranges of the predictor variables make sense?
• What are the distributions of the predictor variables?

Data Set
The dataset utilized in this study consists of a single csv file, designated as "googleplaystore.csv," which encompasses a range of 0 to 10841 instances and 13 attributes. The data pertains to the characteristics of various applications available on the Google Play Store, including columns such as "App," "Category," "Rating," "Reviews," "Size," "Installs," "Type," "Price," "Content Rating," "Genres," "Last Updated," "Current Ver," and "Android Ver." The utilization of linear regression models for predicting the "Rating" (which is on a scale of 1 to 19) based on the most influential columns is deemed appropriate given the nature of the data. The results of the analysis suggest that the dataset is well-suited for investigating the interdependence between the attributes of the Google Play Store Apps and its Rating.
